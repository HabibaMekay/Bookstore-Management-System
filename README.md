# Velvet Spices



Velvet Spices is a bookstore management system that allows users to track and update different books inside the library. The system provides each user type with the appropriate functionalities they need. Whispering Pages has three user types: cashiers, stockers and admins. Cashiers handle book purchases and returns and the system automatically updates the stock. Stockers can add a new book, or remove old books from stock, and admins can add and remove new user accounts for each user type.

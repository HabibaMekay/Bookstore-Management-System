## Description of the Persistence Strategy

We will use Hibernate (JPA) as our Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. Hibernate provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database.

### Entity Annotations:
- Each entity class will be annotated with `@Entity` to flag that it is a JPA entity.
- The `@Id` annotation will be used to show the primary key.
- Inheritance strategies will be managed using `@Inheritance`.

### Relationships:
- One-to-Many relationships (such as BookList to Book) will be handled using the `@OneToMany` annotation.

### Repositories:
- Each entity will have a corresponding repository interface extending `JpaRepository` to handle CRUD operations.
- Custom query methods will be defined in repository interfaces as needed.

### Service Layer:
- A service layer will be implemented for each entity to handle business logic and interact with the repositories.
- Services will provide methods for common operations such as saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting entities.

### Transactions:
- Transaction management will be handled by Spring's `@Transactional` annotation to ensure consistency.
